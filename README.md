# Welcome to my Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) template created for flexible usage of Expo Routing with React Native Drawer and React native Bottom tabs. It also uses React Native Paper for UI designing and it will be installed automatically along with other dependencies.

## Get started

1. Install my custom expo template

   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app project_name --template expo-template-ams_dev
   cd project_name
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
